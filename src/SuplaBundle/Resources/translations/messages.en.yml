actionTrigger_HOLD: Hold
actionTrigger_SHORT_PRESS_X1: Short press once
actionTrigger_SHORT_PRESS_X2: Short press twice
actionTrigger_SHORT_PRESS_X3: Short press three times
actionTrigger_SHORT_PRESS_X4: Short press four times
actionTrigger_SHORT_PRESS_X5: Short press five times
actionTrigger_TOGGLE_X1: Toggle once
actionTrigger_TOGGLE_X2: Toggle twice

actionableSubjectType_channel: Channel
actionableSubjectType_channelGroup: Channel group
actionableSubjectType_notification: Notification
actionableSubjectType_scene: Scene
actionableSubjectType_schedule: Schedule
addToHistoryMeasurementWarningSelected: Selecting this option will result in adding the added value to the future measurements. It might produce an undesired increase in the measurement history chart. We recommend to set this option only during the first counter configuration. If you change it for a counter that already has some logs, consider clearing the history immediately after you save the changes.
addToHistoryMeasurementWarningUnselected: Unselecting this option will result in ignoring the added value in the future measurements. It might produce an undesired decrease in the measurement history chart. We recommend to set this option only during the first counter configuration. If you change it for a counter that already has some logs, consider clearing the history immediately after you save the changes.
channel: Channel
channelConfigHelp_gateCloseAfterHelp: The agent that starts the gate closing procedure can be delayed up to one minute from the set time.
channelConfigHelp_numberOfAttemptsGate: After you request to open or close the gate, we will wait 60 seconds after each relay switch and see if the gate reached the desired state. In case of failure, we will retry the action and check again. Here you can limit the number of these attempts. Recommended value is 5. Change of this parameter does not influence schedules.
channelConfigHelp_stateVerificationMethod: 'Active: the first state change reported by the sensor terminates further attempts to open or close. Passive: we will check the sensor every 60s and terminate further attempts to open or close if the sensor reports the desired state at that moment.'
channelConfig_stateVerificationMethod_active: Active
channelConfig_stateVerificationMethod_passive: Passive
channelGroup: Channel group
directLinkExecutionFailureReason_disabled: Direct link is disabled.
directLinkExecutionFailureReason_executionLimitExceeded: Execution limit has been exceeded.
directLinkExecutionFailureReason_expired: Direct link has expired.
directLinkExecutionFailureReason_forbiddenAction: The requested action is not allowed for this direct link.
directLinkExecutionFailureReason_httpGetForbidden: The action was prevented from being performed using an HTTP GET method that is not permitted.
directLinkExecutionFailureReason_invalidActionParameters: Incorrect direct link parameters
directLinkExecutionFailureReason_invalidChannelState: Invalid channel state.
directLinkExecutionFailureReason_invalidSlug: Given verification code is not valid.
directLinkExecutionFailureReason_noAllowedActions: No allowed actions have been chosen.
directLinkExecutionFailureReason_noSlugOrAction: Invalid request data - code and action required.
directLinkExecutionFailureReason_notActiveYet: Direct link is not active yet.
directLinkExecutionFailureReason_otherFailure: Direct link execution failure.
directLinkExecutionFailureReason_sceneDuringExecution: Scene is being executed now.
directLinkExecutionFailureReason_unsupportedAction: The requested action is not supported.
logs_aggregation_day: Days
logs_aggregation_hour: Hours
logs_aggregation_minute: Minutes
logs_aggregation_month: Months
register-slide1-text: Based on available electronics, SUPLA enables you to build simple modules to navigate and operate building automation elements. Through SUPLA you can, among others, control the lighting, switch on and off household appliances and media, open and shut gates and doors, or control room temperature. All the above can be done with just touch of a finger.
register-slide1-title: Develop your own building automation
register-slide2-text: One of the main assumptions of this project is simplicity and availability. SUPLA allows simple light operation or gate opening, when you want to leave your premises, with just touch of a finger. SUPLA is available from any place on Earth if you just have a smartphone or tables available as well as Internet access.  SUPLA is developed based on an Open Software and Hardware. This way, you can also develop this project!
register-slide2-title: SUPLA everywhere!
register-slide3-text: Building automation systems available on the market are usually very complex, closed and expensive. In many cases they must be installed on the very early stages of house construction.  SUPLA is simple, open and free of charge. It gives an opportunity to build elements based on RaspberryPI, Arduino or ESP8266 platforms and then join them either through LAN or WiFi. Join the project and build your own version of building automation system!
register-slide3-title: Free of charge and open!
