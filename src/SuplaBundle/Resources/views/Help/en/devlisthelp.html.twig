<h1>I/O Devices</h1>

<p><strong>I/O Devices</strong> enable to operate and monitor electronic equipment in your house or office. Devices are based on popular and generally available platforms such as RaspberryPI, Arduino or ESP8266. Each device has so-called channels, their number and assignment is based on given equipment configuration. All the channels can be used either as “Inputs” or “Outputs” and have their type defined. <br /><br />
<strong>Input</strong> – data can be received, e.g. temperature red, sensor status checked<br />
<strong>Output</strong> – the channel allows to operate the equipment<br />
<strong>Type</strong> – defines executive components, e.g. a rely, thermometer<br />
<br /><br />
Channel type also determines available functions, e.g. the relay channel can work as a “Gateway lock operation”, “Door lock operation”, etc.  Each channel can be configured by you to your needs or can be disabled. The selected functions have direct influence on which functions will be available from customer applications installed on your smartphone and tablet. <br/><br />Disabling the device will result in having all the functions available from this device on all hidden client applications. Once it is activated back again, all the functions provided by it will reappear. <br /><br />Status of the device determines whether the instrument is currently connected to server and the date of last connection indicates when the most recent connection has been set. <br /><br />Each function has a default caption, e.g. “Roller shutter”, “Door”. Those captions can be modified to precisely indicate each function, e.g. “Balcony roller shutter”, “Front door”, etc. They can be modified in the settings of each channel. To return to the default settings simply leave the field empty.<br /><br />
In order to connect the I/O Device to the system, you should enter location identifier and password in its settings. When properly connected to the network and authorized, the device will be automatically included on the list.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
