<h1>Access Identifier</h1>

<p><strong>Access Identifier</strong> is kind of a key enabling access to the system through client devices (smartphones/tablets). <br /><br />The User working on a particular identifier will have access to all of the assigned locations being active at a given moment and consequently to all the I/O Devices working within this location. You can create identifiers for individual Users or the whole group. Provide a caption for each identifier for easy and clear identification, for example: “Kids”, “Parents”, “Employees”, “Board”, “John Smith”. . <br /><br /><strong>A changed password must be entered in all the client’s devices working on the modified access identifier. </strong><br /><br />Disabled Access Identifier will immediately result in having all the devices connected to the system through this identifier disabled as well. A disabled identifier can be activated back again any time you want.<br /><br />
Location being either assigned to or removed from an Access Identifier, as well as any settings changes, will automatically influence client’s application content and settings installed on their smartphones and tablets.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
