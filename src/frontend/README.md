# SUPLA CLOUD - Frontend

This directory contains sources of frontend components used in SUPLA CLOUD.

They are written with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
The sources are built with [Vite](https://vite.dev).

## How to build the sources?

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) at least v22.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The first command downloads the Internet. The second one builds the sources
to the output directory (`web/dist`).

## How to develop the frontend components?

In order to start the dev server with continuous building and hot reloads:

```bash
npm run dev
```
